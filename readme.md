# Mooscape - API + Hardware (Built at HackMIT)

EEG headset and web application combined to analyze sleep patterns and potentially recognize signs of insomnia and other sleep disorders. The EEG Headset inputs the brainwaves and then the waves are used to determine how relaxed a person is, while sleeping. Using that, we're tracking the sleep pattern of the user.
